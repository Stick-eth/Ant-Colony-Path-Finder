# AntColonyOptimizer

## Description

This repository contains the implementation of the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm for solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using Python and NetworkX. It includes functions to measure the performance of the ACO algorithm across various metrics and parameters, and visualize the results through comprehensive graphs.

## Features

- **Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)**: Implementation of the ACO algorithm for TSP.
- **Graph Generation**: Functions to generate random weighted graphs using NetworkX.
- **Performance Measurement**: Measure execution time, best path distance, and other metrics while varying graph size and algorithm parameters.
- **Visualization**: Plot results to analyze the impact of different parameters on the algorithm's performance.
- **Brute Force TSP**: Exhaustive search for the optimal path for comparison purposes.

## Usage

1. **Generate Random Graphs**: Create random graphs with different sizes and weights.
2. **Run ACO**: Execute the ACO algorithm with fixed and varying parameters.
3. **Measure Performance**: Collect data on execution time, path length, and other relevant metrics.
4. **Visualize Results**: Generate plots to visualize the performance variations across different parameters.
